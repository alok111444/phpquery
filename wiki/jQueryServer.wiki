*jQueryServer* is a jQuery plugin giving unobstrusive, client-side bindings to server-side implementation of jQuery.

Scenario is simple:
  # Connect to server and make an Ajax request to somewhere (crossdomain allowed)
  # Do some manipulations, you can even trigger a server-side event
  # Get processed date back to browser

Example:
{{{
$.server({url: 'http://somesite.com'})
  .find('.my-class')
    .client(function(response){
      $('.destination').html(response);
});
}}}
Since version *0.5.1* (this is *not* phpQuery release version number) there is a support for config file which *authorizes* Ajax hosts and referers.
